May:

Actual cool stuff:
-> Added the /channel command
-> Added the /exchange command
-> Added the /link command
-> Added the /tutorial command
-> Started adapting the bot to the dapscoin bot github repository so content can be dynamically updated by the foundation members
----> Note: New tutorials are welcomed, you can send them to me (@meteovio) on Telegram
-> Every coin on CMC can now be requested with /p (<- price command)
-> You can now reply to a message with /tip (amount) [optional: reason] to tip the person directly
-> /stake simplified
-> test second

Less relevant stuff:
-> New good bot/bad bot lines
-> /rain now finally announce who did it, lol
-> The bot has now an hourly 8.3% chances of posting a random message

Planned:
-> /info command to show the coin specs.
-> bringing back the /help command to list the available bot commands
-> /suggest or /request command so that people can send me suggestion for the bot
