RUNTIME ERROR

Some older versions of the Mac will get a runtime error when trying to install a new version of the wallet. If this occurs follow these steps:

Download an older version of the wallet here: https://github.com/bumbacoin/PeepCoin-TheCoinForThePeople/releases/download/v1000/Peepcoin-Qt-OSX-v1000.dmg
Open this version, this older wallet will create the wallet.dat file.
Once it opens, close the wallet and use the newer wallet QT you tried previously.
