A coin-day represents the number of days since a particular coin was last transacted on the network.  At any given point in time there exist a limited number coin-days and they accrue in the hands of those who hold large balances for a long period of time.  As a result coin-days can be seen as a proxy for stake in the network.   Coin-days are destroyed every time there is an transaction involving those coins and therefore cannot be reused.
